          <h2>What is the WesternMall?</h2>
            <p class="hidden">(OOC) It is a website where players can spend their hard earned Terran Units. All 
              equipment available in the game will be able to be shopped for here at the 
              WesternMall website.<br><br>
    
              (IC) It's only the best place to shop for the serious merc. Things that go BOOM, things
              that keep you from going BOOM, and a few things to make your life easier are all available
              here at the WesternMall.
              <br>
              <br><sub><em>*OOC is out of character and IC is In Character</em></sub></p>

          <h2>Why a website?</h2>
          <p class="hidden">Three reasons:<br><br>
    
              It's easier than sharing a book.<br>
              It allows for more items to be added over time without publishing a new book.<br>
              It adds a lot more immersion to the game.<br>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Do you have a life outside of game designing and developing?</h2>
          <p class="hidden">No, I do not.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What are the future plans for this site?</h2>
          <p class="hidden">A lot more items, character accounts with GM access to award TU for characters to spend, 
            and shipping manifests to be sent to player email to prove they purchased the items.
          </p>
